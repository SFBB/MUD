# MUD
A simple MUD game.

Just downlaod files, and "make "it.
To run it, run "make run".
To clean temporary files, run "make clean".
To uninstall exuatable file, just run "make uninstall".

Some trouble may be caused old compile or C++ environment.


You can also design this game by yourself by editing Game.cpp.

I am planning to create map editor and game editor.
Please be expected!
