# MUD
A simple MUD game.

>Just downlaod files, and "make "it.<br>
>To run it, run "make run".<br>
>To clean temporary files, run "make clean".<br>
>To uninstall exuatable file, just run "make uninstall".<br>

Some trouble may be caused old compile or C++ environment.


You can also design this game by yourself by editing Game.cpp.

I am planning to create **map editor** and **game editor**.
Please be expected!
